=== Phase 39: Strict Subset Operator ===

TEXT: The strict subset operator (psubset, ⊂) represents proper subset relationships, where A is a subset of B AND A is not equal to B.

TEXT: Distinction from subset (⊆):
TEXT: - A subset B means: every element of A is in B (may be equal)
TEXT: - A psubset B means: every element of A is in B AND A != B (strict inequality)

** Example 1: Basic Strict Subset **

axdef
  A : P N
  B : P N
where
  A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and A psubset B
end

TEXT: Here A psubset B holds because all elements of A are in B, and A contains fewer elements than B.

** Example 2: Comparing subset and psubset **

axdef
  X : P N
  Y : P N
  Z : P N
where
  X = {1, 2} and Y = {1, 2, 3} and Z = {1, 2} and X psubset Y and X subset Z
end

TEXT: X psubset Y is true (X is strictly contained in Y)
TEXT: X subset Z is true (X is a subset of Z, including the case where X = Z)
TEXT: X psubset Z would be FALSE (they are equal sets)

** Example 3: Empty Set **

axdef
  emptySet : P N
  anySet : P N
where
  emptySet = {} and anySet = {1, 2, 3} and emptySet psubset anySet
end

TEXT: The empty set is a strict subset of any non-empty set.

** Example 4: Transitive Property **

TEXT: If A psubset B and B psubset C, then A psubset C.

axdef
  A : P N
  B : P N
  C : P N
where
  A = {1} and B = {1, 2} and C = {1, 2, 3} and A psubset B and B psubset C and A psubset C
end

** Example 5: Set Hierarchy **

given Student, GradStudent, PhDStudent

axdef
  students : P Student
  grads : P GradStudent
  phds : P PhDStudent
where
  phds psubset grads and grads psubset students
end

TEXT: PhD students are a strict subset of graduate students, which are a strict subset of all students.
