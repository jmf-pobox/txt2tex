=== PURETEXT Block Examples ===

** Example 1: Basic PURETEXT **

PURETEXT: This is a verbatim text block. Unlike TEXT blocks, PURETEXT does not apply smart quote conversion or other typographical transformations.

PURETEXT: The characters " and ' remain exactly as typed, without conversion to opening and closing quotes.

** Example 2: Preserving Special Characters **

PURETEXT: In PURETEXT blocks, special characters like & % $ # _ { } are preserved literally without requiring LaTeX escaping.

PURETEXT: Mathematical notation like x^2 or f(n) is also treated as literal text, not as mathematical expressions.

** Example 3: Code Snippets **

PURETEXT: When documenting code or command-line syntax, use PURETEXT to preserve exact formatting:

PURETEXT: $ txt2tex examples/hello_world.txt

PURETEXT: The above command compiles the example to PDF.

** Example 4: Literal Z Notation Syntax **

PURETEXT: To show Z notation syntax without rendering it as formal notation, use PURETEXT:

PURETEXT: forall x : N | x > 0

PURETEXT: This appears as literal text rather than being typeset as a quantified predicate.

** Example 5: Comparison TEXT vs PURETEXT **

TEXT: This block uses smart quotes: "Hello world" becomes properly formatted.

PURETEXT: This block preserves quotes: "Hello world" stays exactly as typed.

TEXT: Mathematical notation x^2 is rendered as a superscript.

PURETEXT: Mathematical notation x^2 appears as literal text.

** Example 6: File Paths land URLs **

PURETEXT: File paths like /Users/name/Documents/file.txt are preserved exactly.

PURETEXT: URLs like https://example.com/path?query=value&other=123 remain unmodified.

** Example 7: Mixed Usage **

TEXT: You can freely mix TEXT and PURETEXT blocks. Use TEXT for normal prose with smart typography.

PURETEXT: Use PURETEXT when you need exact character-for-character reproduction.

TEXT: This combination gives you flexibility: elegant typography when you want it, literal text when you need it.
