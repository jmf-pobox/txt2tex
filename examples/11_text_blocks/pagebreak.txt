// Example: PAGEBREAK Directive
// ============================================================================
// Demonstrates:
//   - PAGEBREAK directive for forcing page breaks
//   - Document structure control
//   - Multi-page document organization
//   - Section separation
//
// Features:
//   - PAGEBREAK [inserts page break]
//   - Useful for submission formatting
//   - Separate solutions or sections
//   - Control document flow
//

=== PAGEBREAK Examples ===

** Example 1: Basic Page Break **

TEXT: This content appears on the first page.

PAGEBREAK

TEXT: This content appears on the next page. The PAGEBREAK directive forces a page break at that point in the document.

** Example 2: Separating Solutions **

TEXT: When preparing solutions for submission, you may want each solution on a separate page.

** Solution 1 **

TEXT: First solution content here.

forall x : N | x >= 0

TEXT: Explanation of solution 1.

PAGEBREAK

** Solution 2 **

TEXT: Second solution content here.

exists y : N | y > 10

TEXT: Explanation of solution 2.

PAGEBREAK

** Solution 3 **

TEXT: Third solution content here.

** Example 3: Section Separation **

=== Section 1: Propositional Logic ===

TEXT: Content for section 1 covering propositional logic operators and truth tables.

p land q => p

TEXT: More content for section 1.

PAGEBREAK

=== Section 2: Predicate Logic ===

TEXT: Content for section 2 covering quantifiers and predicates.

forall x : N | exists y : N | x + y = 10

TEXT: More content for section 2.

** Example 4: Long Proofs **

TEXT: For lengthy proofs, you might want to start each major proof on a new page:

** Theorem 1 **

PROOF:
(p land (p => q)) => q [=> intro from 1]
  [1] p land (p => q) [assumption]
      :: p [land elim 1]
      :: p => q [land elim 2]
      q [=> elim]

TEXT: End of proof for Theorem 1.

PAGEBREAK

** Theorem 2 **

PROOF:
(p lor q) land (lnot q) => p [=> intro from 1]
  [1] (p lor q) land (lnot q) [assumption]
      p lor q [land elim 1]
      lnot q [land elim 2]
      p [lor elim]

TEXT: End of proof for Theorem 2.

** Example 5: Strategic Page Breaks **

TEXT: Use PAGEBREAK strategically to improve document readability. Don't overuse it—let LaTeX handle most page breaking automatically.

TEXT: Good uses of PAGEBREAK include:
TEXT: - Starting new major sections
TEXT: - Separating independent solutions
TEXT: - Ensuring related content stays together

** Example 6: Avoiding Orphans **

TEXT: When you have a section title or definition that would appear at the bottom of a page with its content on the next page, you might insert a PAGEBREAK before the section.

PAGEBREAK

=== Important Definition ===

axdef
  critical : N -> N
where
  forall n : N | critical(n) = n * n
end

TEXT: This ensures the definition stays with its title.

** Example 7: Submission Formatting **

TEXT: For coursework submissions, instructors may require one solution per page:

** Problem 1 **

TEXT: Solution to problem 1 goes here.

PAGEBREAK

** Problem 2 **

TEXT: Solution to problem 2 goes here.

PAGEBREAK

** Problem 3 **

TEXT: Solution to problem 3 goes here.

TEXT: This format makes it easy for instructors to review and grade individual problems.
