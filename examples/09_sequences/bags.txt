=== Bags (Multisets) ===

** Example 1: Bag Type **

TEXT: Bags are unordered collections that allow duplicates:

bag N

bag Z

** Example 2: Bag Literals **

TEXT: Bags are written with double square brackets:

[[x]]

[[a, b, c]]

[[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]]

** Example 3: Bags vs Sets **

TEXT: Unlike sets, bags preserve multiplicity:

TEXT: The bag [[1, 2, 2, 3]] is different from the set {1, 2, 3}

TEXT: The bag [[a, a, a]] contains three copies of a

** Example 4: Bags in Specifications **

TEXT: Bags can model collections where order doesn't matter but quantity does:

coins in bag Coin

items in bag Item
