=== Sequence Operations ===

** Example 1: Sequence Length **

TEXT: The cardinality operator gives the length of a sequence:

# <>

# <a, b, c>

# s

** Example 2: Head and Tail **

TEXT: Basic sequence decomposition:

head <a, b, c>

tail <a, b, c>

head s

tail s

** Example 3: Last and Front **

TEXT: Operations on the end of sequences:

last <a, b, c>

front <a, b, c>

last s

front s

** Example 4: Reverse **

TEXT: Reversing a sequence:

rev <>

rev <a>

rev <a, b, c>

rev (rev s)

** Example 5: Domain and Range **

TEXT: Sequences are functions from indices to elements:

dom <>

dom <a, b, c, d>

ran <a, b, c>
