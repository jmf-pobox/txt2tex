# Lecture 5: Sets and Types

This directory contains examples for Lecture 5, covering sets, types, and set operations.

## Topics Covered

- Set literals and notation
- Set membership (`in`, `notin`)
- Set relations (`subset`, `psubset`, `union`, `intersect`, set difference)
- Power sets (`P`, `P1`, `F`)
- Cardinality (`#`)
- Cartesian products (`cross`)
- Tuple construction and component selection
- Set comprehension
- Distributed union and intersection
- Standard sets (Z, N)

## Key Operators

```
{1, 2, 3}            →  {1, 2, 3}       [set literal]
x in A               →  x ∈ A           [membership]
A subset B           →  A ⊆ B           [subset]
A union B            →  A ∪ B           [union]
A intersect C        →  A ∩ C           [intersection]
P S                  →  P S             [power set]
# S                  →  # S             [cardinality]
A cross B            →  A × B           [Cartesian product]
{ x : N | x > 0 }    →  {x : ℕ | x > 0} [set comprehension]
```
