=== Unique Existence ===

** Example 1: Unique Quantifier (exists1) **

TEXT: The unique existence quantifier asserts there is exactly one value satisfying the predicate:

exists1 x : N | x = 5

exists1 n : N | forall m : N | n <= m

** Example 2: Multiple Conditions **

TEXT: Unique existence with compound predicates:

exists1 y : N | y in {0, 1} and y != 1

exists1 z : Z | z^2 = 4 and z > 0

** Example 3: One-Point Rule **

TEXT: When a unique value is specified by equality, we can apply the one-point rule:

EQUIV:
exists y : N | y in {0, 1} and y != 1 and x != y
<=> exists y : N | y = 0 and x != y [arithmetic]
<=> 0 in N and x != 0 [one-point rule]
<=> x != 0

** Example 4: Unique in Domain **

TEXT: Testing uniqueness within a specific domain:

exists1 p : P {0, 1} | # p = 1

exists1 x : {1, 2, 3, 4} | x > 3
