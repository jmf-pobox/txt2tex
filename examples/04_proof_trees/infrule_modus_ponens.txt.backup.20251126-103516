// Example: INFRULE - Modus Ponens
// Demonstrates inference rule syntax with --- separator (generates \derive)
// From ZED2E_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md - inference rules

TEXT: Modus ponens is a fundamental inference rule in propositional logic.
TEXT: If we know P is true and P implies Q, we can conclude Q is true.

INFRULE:
P
P => Q
---
Q [modus ponens]

TEXT: The horizontal line (generated by ---) separates premises from conclusion.
TEXT: The label in brackets appears to the right of the conclusion.

TEXT: Here's a more complex example with multiple premises:

INFRULE:
P => Q
Q => R
P
---
R [chain of implications]

TEXT: We can also use INFRULE without labels:

INFRULE:
A and B
---
A [conjunction elimination]
