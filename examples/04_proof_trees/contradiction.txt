=== Proof by Contradiction Examples ===

** Example 1: Basic Contradiction **

TEXT: To prove P, assume not P and derive a contradiction (false).

PROOF:
  not P [assumption 1]
  ...
  Q [from not P]
  not Q [known fact]
  false [contradiction]
  P [not intro from 1]

TEXT: Once we derive false, we can conclude anything—here we conclude P by discharging assumption 1.

** Example 2: Simple Example - Proving p **

TEXT: Prove: (p and not p) => q

PROOF:
  p and not p [premise]
  p [and elim left]
  not p [and elim right]
  false [contradiction]
  q [false elim]

TEXT: From a contradiction, we can derive anything (ex falso quodlibet).

** Example 3: Proving not (p and not p) **

TEXT: Prove that p and not p is always false.

PROOF:
  p and not p [assumption 1]
  p [and elim left]
  not p [and elim right]
  false [contradiction]
  not (p and not p) [not intro from 1]

TEXT: This proves the law of non-contradiction.

** Example 4: Indirect Proof **

TEXT: Prove: (not p => false) => p

PROOF:
  not p => false [premise]
  not p [assumption 1]
  false [=> elim]
  p [false elim]
  not not p [not intro from 1]

TEXT: This is the pattern for indirect proof: if assuming not p leads to false, then p must hold (in classical logic).

** Example 5: Modus Tollens via Contradiction **

TEXT: Prove: (p => q) and not q => not p

PROOF:
  p => q [premise]
  not q [premise]
  p [assumption 1]
  q [=> elim]
  false [contradiction with not q]
  not p [not intro from 1]

TEXT: Classic modus tollens pattern using contradiction.

** Example 6: Disjunction from Contradiction **

TEXT: Prove: not p => (p => q)

PROOF:
  not p [premise]
  p [assumption 1]
  false [contradiction]
  q [false elim]
  p => q [=> intro from 1]

TEXT: From not p, we can prove p => q for any q.

** Example 7: Double Negation Elimination **

TEXT: Prove: not not p => p (requires classical logic)

PROOF:
  not not p [premise]
  not p [assumption 1]
  false [contradiction]
  p [false elim]
  not not not p [not intro from 1]

TEXT: In classical logic, not not p implies p. This requires excluded middle or equivalent axiom.

** Example 8: Reductio ad Absurdum **

TEXT: Prove: (not p => (q and not q)) => p

PROOF:
  not p => (q and not q) [premise]
  not p [assumption 1]
  q and not q [=> elim]
  q [and elim left]
  not q [and elim right]
  false [contradiction]
  p [false elim]
  not not p [not intro from 1]
  p [double negation elim]

TEXT: Reductio ad absurdum: if assuming not p leads to absurdity, then p holds.

** Example 9: Contradiction with Universal Quantifier **

TEXT: Prove: (forall x | P(x)) and (exists x | not P(x)) is contradictory.

PROOF:
  forall x | P(x) [premise]
  exists x | not P(x) [premise]
  not P(a) [exists elim, fresh a]
  P(a) [forall elim]
  false [contradiction]

TEXT: If something holds for all x, it cannot fail for some x.

** Example 10: Proving Uniqueness by Contradiction **

TEXT: Prove: if f is injective, then f(x) = f(y) => x = y.

PROOF:
  f is injective [premise]
  f(x) = f(y) [premise]
  x /= y [assumption 1]
  f(x) /= f(y) [injective property]
  false [contradiction with f(x) = f(y)]
  not (x /= y) [not intro from 1]
  x = y [double negation]

TEXT: Uses contradiction to prove equality.

** Example 11: Case Analysis Leading to Contradiction **

TEXT: Prove: p or q, not p, not q => false

PROOF:
  p or q [premise]
  not p [premise]
  not q [premise]
  CASE p:
    false [contradiction with not p]
  CASE q:
    false [contradiction with not q]
  false [or elim]

TEXT: Both cases lead to contradiction, so the premises are inconsistent.

** Example 12: Best Practices for Contradiction Proofs **

TEXT: When using proof by contradiction:
TEXT: 1. Clearly mark the assumption you're contradicting with [assumption N]
TEXT: 2. Show explicitly where false is derived
TEXT: 3. Use [not intro from N] to discharge the assumption
TEXT: 4. Document the contradiction (what conflicts with what)
TEXT: 5. In natural deduction, false elim lets you conclude anything
TEXT: 6. Remember: contradiction is a classical technique (not constructive)
