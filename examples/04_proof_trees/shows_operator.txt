// Example: shows operator (Sequent Judgment)
// Demonstrates the turnstile operator for sequent calculus
// From ZED2E_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md - inference rules

TEXT: The "shows" operator represents sequent judgment (turnstile).
TEXT: In sequent calculus, "Gamma shows Delta" means "from context Gamma, we can derive Delta".

TEXT: Simple sequent judgment:

Gamma shows Delta

TEXT: More concrete example with specific propositions:

(P land Q) shows P

TEXT: Sequent with multiple context items (using sets):

{P, P => Q} shows Q

TEXT: We can use shows in inference rules to represent natural deduction:

INFRULE:
Gamma shows P
Gamma shows (P => Q)
---
Gamma shows Q [modus ponens elem sequent form]

TEXT: Combining shows with inference rules for natural deduction style:

INFRULE:
Gamma shows A
Gamma shows B
---
Gamma shows (A land B) [conjunction introduction]

TEXT: The shows operator renders as the turnstile symbol in LaTeX.
