** Test: Phase A - Verify Phase 14-16 Features **

(a) Test ASCII sequence brackets and pattern matching:

axdef
  viewed : seq(Entry) -> seq(Entry)
where
  viewed(<>) = <>
  forall x : Entry; s : seq(Entry) |
    viewed(<x> ^ s) = if x.3 = yes then <x> ^ viewed(s) else viewed(s)
end

(b) Test conditional expressions:

axdef
  abs : Z -> N
where
  forall x : Z | abs(x) = if x >= 0 then x else -x
end

(c) Test multi-word identifiers with underscore:

axdef
  cumulative_total : seq(N) -> N
where
  cumulative_total(<>) = 0
  forall x : N; s : seq(N) |
    cumulative_total(<x> ^ s) = x + cumulative_total(s)
end

(d) Test all three features combined:

axdef
  premium_plays : seq(Play) -> seq(Play)
where
  premium_plays(<>) = <>
  forall x : Play; s : seq(Play) |
    premium_plays(<x> ^ s) = if user_status(x.2) = premium then <x> ^ premium_plays(s) else premium_plays(s)
end
