=== Proof Tree Nesting Depth Test ===

** Test 1: Simple (depth 1) **

PROOF:
  p => q [=> intro from 1]
    [1] p [assumption]
    :: q [axiom]

** Test 2: Moderate (depth 2) **

PROOF:
  p => (q => r) [=> intro from 1]
    [1] p [assumption]
    :: q => r [=> intro from 2]
      [2] q [assumption]
      :: r [axiom]

** Test 3: Deep (depth 3) **

PROOF:
  p => (q => (r => s)) [=> intro from 1]
    [1] p [assumption]
    :: q => (r => s) [=> intro from 2]
      [2] q [assumption]
      :: r => s [=> intro from 3]
        [3] r [assumption]
        :: s [axiom]

** Test 4: Very Deep (depth 4) **

PROOF:
  p => (q => (r => (s => t))) [=> intro from 1]
    [1] p [assumption]
    :: q => (r => (s => t)) [=> intro from 2]
      [2] q [assumption]
      :: r => (s => t) [=> intro from 3]
        [3] r [assumption]
        :: s => t [=> intro from 4]
          [4] s [assumption]
          :: t [axiom]

** Test 5: Horizontal siblings (depth 2) **

PROOF:
  (p and q) => r [=> intro from 1]
    [1] p and q [assumption]
    :: r [and elim]
      :: p [from 1]
      :: q [from 1]
