(a)

axdef
  playlistCount : SongId +-> N
where
  forall i : songs | playlistCount(i) = # {p : dom(playlist) | i in ran(playlist(p))}
end

TEXT: (Parts b-c use complex conditional logic - testing basic parts only)

** Solution 52 **

TEXT: These solutions use pattern matching with conditionals like:
TEXT: premiumPlays(<>) = <>
TEXT: forall x : Play; s : seq(Play) |
TEXT:     premiumPlays(<x> ^ s) = <x> ^ premiumPlays(s)   if userStatus(x.2) = premium
TEXT:                              premiumPlays(s)          if userStatus(x.2) = standard
