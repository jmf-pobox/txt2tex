PROOF:
p and (q or r) => (p and q) or (p and r) [=> intro from 1]
  [1] p and (q or r) [assumption]
      p [and elim 1]
      q or r [and elim 2]
      (p and q) or (p and r) [or elim]
        case q:
          :: p [from above]
          :: q [from case]
          p and q [and intro]
          (p and q) or (p and r) [or intro 1]
        case r:
          :: p [from above]
          :: r [from case]
          p and r [and intro]
          (p and q) or (p and r) [or intro 2]
