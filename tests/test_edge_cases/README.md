# Test Edge Cases

Tests for unusual, boundary, and error conditions.

## Test Coverage

- Malformed input handling
- Empty structures
- Deeply nested expressions
- Unusual whitespace and formatting
- Syntax errors and recovery
- Character encoding edge cases

## Purpose

This directory contains tests for unusual inputs, error conditions, and boundary cases that may not fit into lecture-based categories. These tests help ensure robust error handling and prevent regressions.
