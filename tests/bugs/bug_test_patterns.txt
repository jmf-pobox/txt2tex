=== Test exact patterns ===

** Pattern 1: Works - comparison before bullet, notin after **

(forall x : N | x > 0 . x notin S)

** Pattern 2: Test - IN before bullet, comparison after **

(forall x : N | x in S . y < 10)

** Pattern 3: Test - IN before bullet, IN after (same variable) **

(forall x : N | x in S . x in T)

** Pattern 4: Test - IN before bullet, IN after (different variable) **

(forall x : N | x in S . y in T)
