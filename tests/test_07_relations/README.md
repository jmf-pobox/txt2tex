# Test 07: Relations

Tests for binary relations and relational operators (Lecture 7).

## Test Coverage

- Maplets: `x |-> y`
- Domain and range: `dom R`, `ran R`
- Relational image: `R(| s |)`
- Domain/range restriction: `s <| R`, `R |> s`
- Relational composition: `R ; S`
- Relational operators: inverse, closure
