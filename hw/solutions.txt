=== Propositional Logic ===

TEXT: Answers typically leverage the grammar's order of precedence (not, and, or, =>, <=>) rather than clarifying parenthesis (Simpson, 2025a, slide 20).

** Question 1 **

TEXT: Lecture 1 - Propositions

(a) TRUTH TABLE:                                                                            
p | not p | (not p => p) | p => (not p => p)
T | F | T | T                                  
F | T | F | T

TEXT: p => (not p => p) is a tautology as it is true for every interpretation of p as illustrated by the final column of truth values.


(b) TRUTH TABLE:                                                                            
p | q | (q => p) | not p | not q | (not p => not q) | (not p => not q) <=> (q => p)
t | t | t | f | f | t | t
t | f | t | f | t | t | t
f | t | f | t | f | f | t
f | f | t | t | t | t | t

TEXT: The statements (not p =>  not q), (q => p) are equivalent and (not p =>  not q) <=> (q => p) is a tautology as it is true for every interpretation of p, q as illustrated by the final column of truth values.

(c) TRUTH TABLE:
p | q | r | (p => r) | (q => r) | ((p =>r) and (q => r)) | (p or q) | ((p or q) => r) | <=>
t | t | t | t | t | t | t | t | t
t | t | f | f | f | f | t | f | t
t | f | t | t | t | t | t | t | t
t | f | f | f | t | f | t | f | t
f | t | t | t | t | t | t | t | t
f | t | f | t | f | f | t | f | t
f | f | t | t | t | t | f | t | t
f | f | f | t | t | t | f | t | t

TEXT: The statements ((p => r) and (q => r)), ((p or q) => r) are equivalent and ((p => r) and (q => r)) <=> ((p or q) => r) is a tautology as it is true for every interpretation of p, q, r as illustrated by the final column of truth values.

** Question 2 **

TEXT: Lecture 1 - Propositions

(a) EQUIV:
p => (not p => p) 
p => (not not p or p) [=> disjunction]
p => (p or p) [not not]
p => p [idempotence of p]
true [tautology]

TEXT: In this equivalence proof, we show that p => (not p => p) by using implication disjunction to replace the implication with a logical or, the definition of double negation to simplify, the application of the idempotence rule to simplify, and the fact that p => p is a tautology. 

(b) EQUIV:
(not p => not q)
(not not p or not q) [=> disjunction]
(p or not q) [not not]
(not q or p) [commutativity of or]
q => p [=> disjunction]

TEXT: In this equivalance proof, we show that (not p => not q) <=> q => p by using implication disjunction to replace implication with logical or, the definition of double negation to simplify, the commutivity property of logical or to change the order of the elements, and the implication disjunction rule to reintroduce implication.

(c) EQUIV:
((p => r) and (q => r))
((not p or r) and (not q or r)) [=> disjunction]
(r or not p) and (r or not q) [commutativity of or]
r or (not p and not q) [distributivity 2]
(not p and not q) or r [commutativity of or]
not (p or q) or r [De Morgan]
p or q => r [=> disjunction]

TEXT: In this equivalence proof, we show that ((p => r) and (q => r)) <=> (p or q) => r by using the implication disjunction rule to replace implication with logical or, the commutativity of or rule to change the order of the elements, the distributivity 2 rule to extract r, and the commutivity of logical or to change the order of the elements, De Morgan to extract negation for (not p and not q), and the implication disjunction rule to reintroduce implication.

** Question 3 **

TEXT: Lecture 3 - Deductive Proofs

(a) PROOF: 
  p => (not p => p) [=> intro from 1]
    p [from 1]
    [1] p [assumption]
        not p => p [=> intro from 2]
          p [from 1]
          not p [false elim from 3]
            false [false-intro]
              [2] not p [assumption]
              [3] p [assumption]

TEXT: For this proof we are seeking to prove that p => (not p => p), which we know holds given the truth table in 1(a). Working mechanically from the bottom, I started by applying the implication introduction rule with assumption [1] to gain our conclusion, implication introduction rule with assumption [2] to gain (not p => p).  This statement requires that I have both p and not p as premisses, which is a bit odd and implied I needed to use false in the proof.  Since I had p as assumption [1], I knew I wanted not p as the output of the false rules.  It took some experimentation, but eventually I realized I needed three assumptions not two and it was obvious that I wanted to preserve not p as assumption [2], which meant I needed p as assumption [3] and that assumption [3] would be discharged by the false-elim rule.  In the final proof, all assumptions are discharged properly. The key insight was to have p as an assumption twice at different scopes.

(b) 

TEXT: This proof involves equivalence or bi-implication, which requires us to show p => q and q => p given this is the definition of p <=> q.

TEXT: In one direction, we are seeking to prove (not p => not q) => q => p:

PROOF:
  (not p => not q) => (q => p) [=> intro from 1]
    [1] not p => not q [assumption]
    :: q => p [=> intro from 2]
      [2] q [assumption]
      :: p [false elim from 3]
        false [false-intro]
          :: not q [=> elim]
            :: not p => not q [from 1]
            [3] not p [assumption]
          :: q [from 2]

TEXT: I started working mechanically from the bottom by applying the implication introduction rule to construct the conclusion.  This gave me q => p as the key premise to build up, which requires applying the implication introduction rule to q and p. Looking at the need for q and looking at the need for p and (not p => not q) as assumption [1], I felt it would be best to try not p as an assumption to at least get going.  This enabled me to work top down to get not q from the implication elimination rule. From there, I realized that I needed the negation of both not q and not p. I knew the false-intro and false-elim were required, but it took some experimentation to see that I could get both not q and not p transformed into p and q by making not p assumption [3] instead of [2] and introducing q as assumption [2]. Once that insight was made, I could arrive at p as a result of the top of the tree and retain q [2] as an assumption coming out of false-elim. This is what I needed to arrive at q => p and to connect the bottom and top portions of my proof.  All assumptions are properly discharged.

TEXT: and in the other, we are seeking to prove (q => p) => (not p => not q):

PROOF:
  (q => p) => (not p => not q) [=> intro from 1]
    [1] q => p [assumption]
    :: not p => not q [=> intro from 2]
      [2] not p [assumption]
      :: not q [false elim from 3]
        false [false-intro]
          :: p [=> elim]
            :: q => p [from 1]
            [3] q [assumption]
          :: not p [from 2]

TEXT: Working mechanically from the bottom, I apply the implication rule to q => p as assumption [1] to gain the conclusion.  I need (not p => not q), which shows me to use the implication rule again with (not p) as assumption [2].  From there, the question is how to get not q.  Now working from the top, given assumption [1] has q, it makes sense to use the implication elimation rule with q as assumption [3]. This gives me p, when what I want is not q.  I see that if I introduce not p as assumption [3] that I can negate q via the false-intro and false-elim rules and successfully discharge assumption [3]. This gives me not q, which is what I need to connect to the top tree to the bottom of the proof. This proof came more quickly because q => p as assumption [1] gave clear direction for the top portion. All assumptions are discharged and scopes are appropriate.

TEXT: We then combine these two proofs with the <=>-intro rule, using the results from above:

PROOF:
  (not p => not q) <=> (q => p) [<=> intro]
    :: (not p => not q) => (q => p)
    :: (q => p) => (not p => not q)

(c)

TEXT: In one direction, we are seeking to prove (p => r) and (q => r) => (p or q => r):

PROOF:
  ((p => r) and (q => r)) => ((p or q) => r) [=> intro from 1]
    [1] (p => r) and (q => r) [assumption]
    :: (p or q) => r [=> intro from 2]
      [2] p or q [assumption]
      :: r [or elim from 3]
        case p:
          :: p => r [and elim 1]
            :: (p => r) and (q => r) [from 1]
          :: r [=> elim]
            [3] p [assumption]
        case q:
          :: q => r [and elim 2]
            :: (p => r) and (q => r) [from 1]
          :: r [=> elim]
            [3] q [assumption]

TEXT: In this proof, I start by working from the bottom mechanically, taking (p => r) and (q => r) as assumption [1] and applying the implication introduction rule to arrive at our conclusion and discharge assumption [1]. From there, I can see that I need (p or q) and r as inputs to the implication introduction rule.  I take (p or q) as assumption [2] and discharge this assumption via this rule.  That leaves me with r as the result of my bottom up process.

TEXT: In the other direction, we are seeking to prove (p or q => r) => (p => r) and (q => r):

PROOF:
((p or q) => r) => ((p => r) and (q => r))  [=> intro from 1]
  [1] ((p or q) => r) [assumption]
  :: ((p => r) and (q => r)) [and intro]
    :: p => r [=> intro from 2]
      p [from 2]
      :: r [=> elim]
        :: (p or q) => r [from 1]
        :: p or q [or intro1]
          [2] p [assumption]
    :: q => r [=> intro from 3]
      [3] q [assumption]
      :: r [=> elim]
        :: (p or q) => r [from 1]
        :: p or q [or intro1]
          [2] p [assumption]

TEXT: We then combine these two proofs with the <=>-intro rule, using the results from above:

PROOF:
  ((p => r) and (q => r)) <=> ((p or q) => r) [<=> intro]
    :: ((p => r) and (q => r)) => ((p or q) => r)
    :: ((p or q) => r) => ((p => r) and (q => r))
